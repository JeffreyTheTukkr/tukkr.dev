title: Modern CSS Reset for 2024

description: Do we still need those older and heavy CSS reset libraries, or is there a more modern, lightweight solution in 2024? Based on 2 great frontend developers, I've found a nice and more modern solution!
---

Since the beginning of my web development journey I have pretty much always used a CSS reset library like [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/), or even before that [meyerweb.com](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/), however do we still need these in 2024 and isn't there a more modern version I wondered. Well, 2 great frontend developers, [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com) and [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk) have researched this individually and came to pretty much the same CSS reset values!

Based on their results I've slightly refactored both of their code to be more inline with how I want my default styling to look like, and I have been using for a while now without issues.

```scss
/**
 * custom css reset
 *
 * based on:
 * - joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/#digit-font-smoothing
 * - andy-bell.co.uk/a-modern-css-reset
 */

// more-intuitive box sizing model
*,
*::before,
*::after {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

// remove default margins
* {
    margin: 0;
}

// inherit viewport height
html {
    height: auto;
}

// minimum viewport height to allow for scrolling of content
// and improved text rendering
body {
    min-height: 100vh;
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}

// enable smooth scrolling
html:focus-within {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

// avoid text overflows
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6,
p {
    overflow-wrap: break-word;
}

// pass underline under glyphs
a {
    text-decoration-skip-ink: auto;
}

// inherit font on form elements
input,
button,
textarea,
select {
    font: inherit;
}

// improved media defaults
img,
picture,
svg,
canvas,
video,
audio {
    display: block;
    max-width: 100%;
}

// disable animations if browser preference is set
@media (prefers-reduced-motion) {
    *,
    ::before,
    ::after {
        animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
        animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
        transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
        scroll-behavior: auto !important;
    }
}
```
